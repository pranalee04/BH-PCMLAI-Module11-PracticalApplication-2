# What drives the price of a car?
**OVERVIEW**

The  goal of this practical assignment is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive and provide recommendations to my client who is a used car dealership as to what consumers value in a used car. Another important learning  goal of this assigment is to study and use the CRISP-DM Framework.

**CRISP-DM Framework**
The Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a process model that serves as the base for a data science process. It has six sequential phases:

* Business understanding – What does the business need?
* Data understanding – What data do we have / need? Is it clean?
* Data preparation – How do we organize the data for modeling?
* Modeling – What modeling techniques should we apply?
* Evaluation – Which model best meets the business objectives?
* Deployment – How do stakeholders access the results?

**Dataset:**
In this practicle application, I explored a dataset use car vehical dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars however the [vehicles.csv](https://github.com/pranalee04/BH-PCMLAI-Module11-PracticalApplication-2/blob/main/dataset/vehicles.csv) dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing for the practical assignment.

**Programming language** 
The programming language used is Python, and the libraries used were: Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib,  Numpy , Sklearn,Statsmodels

**Code and Analysis:**
The complete analysis, including observations,commentss so all the work done is contained in the following Jupiter Notebook:
